# Nuts&Bolts

The hacked together project for the E3S2 Hackathon 2024, brought to you by team HereForTheShirt. Nuts&Bolts is a technician service hiring app that allows you to call a technician that fixes any maintenance or technical issue in your home.

## Installing the App

The apk to download the app are available in the 'Releases' section.

## For Developers

First, acquire an OpenAI API key and place it in a `.env` file in the root of the project. The key should be named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. It should look like this:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

1. Clone the git repository
2. Change your working directory to the project with `cd nutsnbolts`
3. Next, run `flutter pub get` and `dart run build_runner build` to generate the necessary files for the project.
4. Run it with a connected device by running `flutter run`
